<h1> Assignment 1 </h1>
<h3> Practicing git and JSP. </h3>

Dear students,

In this assignment, you need to submit your first JSP file. It requires additional reading and practicing. The requirements are simple:

<h4> JSP related: </h4>
<ul>
  <li>write a JSP code that performs simple arithmetic operations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication and division on two integers provided in request parameters (e.g., webpage.jsp?op=op_code&p1=x&p2=y). Op_codes can be:
    <ul>
      <li>add</li>
      <li>sub</li>
      <li>mul</li>
      <li>div</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>There can be some unexpected situations: Op_code is not a valid one or division by zero. Make sure you handle these kinds of errors in a nice way. Please, use your design knowledge from WM1 (do not overuse anything though).</li>
  <li>Provide a link to another JSP page where you show the detailed report about the client (i.e., the browser, OS, etc.) using request object. </li>
</ul>

<h4> Submission related: </h4>
<ul>
  <li> Make sure you configured your git client (i.e., username and email is set). Use firstname_lastname as the username. </li>
  <li> Please, also ensure that you regularly check, add and commit your changes to the remote repo so that we can see your progress. </li>
</ul>

This assignment will give you <strong>10%</strong> of the total. <br />
<em> Good luck! </em> <br />
